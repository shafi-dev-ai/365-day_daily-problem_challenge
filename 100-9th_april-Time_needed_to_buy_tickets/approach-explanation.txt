Approach
1. Initialize a variable time to keep track of the total time taken.
2. While the person at position k hasn't bought all their tickets:
Iterate through the queue and let each person buy a ticket.
Update the queue by decrementing the number of tickets for the person who bought a ticket.
Increment the time by 1 second for each pass.
3. Return the total time taken.
Complexity
Time complexity:
The algorithm iterates through each person in the queue once, so the time complexity of the loop is O(n), where n is the number of people in the queue.
Space complexity:
The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables such as total, i, and x.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
