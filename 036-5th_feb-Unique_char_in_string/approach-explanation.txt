Approach:

Initialize an unordered map (mp) to store character counts.
Iterate through the string to update character counts in the map.
Iterate through the string again, return the index of the first character with a count of 1.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(U)
(U is the number of unique characters in the string)
