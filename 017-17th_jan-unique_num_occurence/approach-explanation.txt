Create an unordered map freq to store the frequency of each element in the array.
Iterate through each element of the input array (arr).
Update the frequency count in the freq map.
Create an unordered set s to store unique frequencies.
Iterate through the entries in the freq map and insert the frequencies into the set s.
Check if the size of the freq map is equal to the size of the set s. If they are equal, it means that the occurrences of frequencies are unique.
