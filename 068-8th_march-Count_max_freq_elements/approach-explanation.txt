Intuition
It needs a container for storing the counting results

2nd Approach is a 1 pass solution implemented in C++ which runs in 0ms & beats 100%.

Approach:
Since the constraints 1 <= nums[i] <= 100, an array of size 101 is suitable for solving problem, no need for a hash table(C++ unordered_map).

Use a loop to count the frequencies storing in freq & max frequency maxF
Use a loop to find the number f in freq with f==maxF & add it to ans
return ans
2nd approach is just to combine the 2 loops into one loop which is more compact written.

Complexity:

Time complexity:
O(n+m) where m = ∣freq∣ ≤ max(nums) ≤ 100

Space complexity:
O(m)
