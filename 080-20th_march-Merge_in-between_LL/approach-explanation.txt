Intuition:

To solve this problem, we need to traverse list1 to find the nodes at positions a and b. Once we locate these nodes, we can splice list2 between them. We'll connect the node before position a to the head of list2, and the last node of list2 to the node after position b.

Approach:

Traverse list1 to find the node at position a-1, a, and b+1.
Attach the last node of list2 to the node after position b.
Attach the node before position a to the head of list2.
Return the head of list1.
Complexity:

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of list1 since we traverse it once to find the positions.
Space complexity: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.
