Intuition
Multiply all elements and divide it by respective element

Approach
Initialize a result array answers of the same size as the input array nums.
Initialize two variables product and zeros to 1 and 0 respectively.
Iterate through the nums array:
If the current element is 0, increment the zeros count.
Otherwise, multiply product by the current element.
Iterate through the nums array again:
If the current element is not 0:
If zeros is greater than 1, push 0 into the answers array.
Otherwise, push product divided by the current element into the answers array.
If the current element is 0:
If zeros is 1, push product into the answers array.
Otherwise, push 0 into the answers array.
Return the answers array.
