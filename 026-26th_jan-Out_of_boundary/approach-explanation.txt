Approaches:

Initialization:

Initialize a 2D vector dp of size m x n to represent the number of ways to reach each cell.
Set the starting cell (x, y) to 1, as there is one way to reach it initially.
Counting Paths:

Use a nested loop to iterate over the number of moves from 1 to N.
For each cell (i, j) in the grid:
If (i, j) is on the boundary, increment the count by the value of dp[i][j]. This accounts for paths going out of the grid.
Update temp[i][j] based on the sum of the ways to reach the adjacent cells in the previous state (dp).
Use modulo M to avoid integer overflow.
Updating State:

Update the dp vector with the values from the temp vector for the next iteration.
Return Result:

Return the final count, representing the total number of paths that lead out of the grid after N moves.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(Nmn)
(dp array with dimensions m×nm \times nm×n NNN times)

Space complexity:
O(mn)
(dp and temptemptemp array of size m×nm \times nm×n are used.)
