Intuition
The problem can be solved by dynamic programming, considering the two scenarios at each house: whether to rob it or not. The goal is to maximize the total amount of money robbed without alerting the police.

Approach
Use two variables, rob and norob, to keep track of the maximum amount of money robbed with or without robbing the current house.
Iterate through each house, and at each step, calculate the maximum amount of money if the current house is robbed (newRob) and if it is not robbed (newNoRob).
Update rob and norob for the next iteration.
The final result is the maximum amount between the two scenarios: robbing the last house or not robbing it.
Complexity
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of houses.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we use constant space for variables rob and norob.
