Intuition
The problem requires finding the longest subarray where the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum elements is less than or equal to a given limit. To achieve this, we can use a sliding window technique combined with two deques to keep track of the minimum and maximum elements within the current window.

Approach
Deques for Tracking Min and Max:

Use two deques: increase to keep track of the increasing order of elements (for the minimum value) and decrease for the decreasing order of elements (for the maximum value).
Sliding Window Technique:

Iterate through the array while maintaining a sliding window.
For each element, add it to both deques:
Remove elements from the back of increase deque until the last element is greater than the current element.
Remove elements from the back of decrease deque until the last element is less than the current element.
Add the current element to the back of both deques.
Adjust Window:

Check the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the current window (front elements of the decrease and increase deques respectively).
If the difference exceeds the limit, adjust the window by moving the left pointer until the difference is within the limit again.
Remove elements from the deques if they are equal to the element at the left pointer before incrementing the left pointer.
Track Maximum Size:

Calculate the size of the current valid window and update the maximum size if the current size is larger.
Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is added and removed from the deques at most once, leading to linear time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, for the space used by the deques.
Step by Step Explanation
Example
Input: nums = [8, 2, 4, 7], limit = 4
Expected Output: 2
Initial State
Index	Value	Increase Deque	Decrease Deque	Left	Right	Max Length
0		0
Iteration 1: Right = 0
Add 8 to both deques.
Deques after adding: increase = [8], decrease = [8]
Max Length = 1
Index	Value	Increase Deque	Decrease Deque	Left	Right	Max Length
0	8	[8]	[8]	0	0	1
Iteration 2: Right = 1
Add 2 to increase and decrease.
Deques after adding: increase = [2, 8], decrease = [8, 2]
Difference: 8 - 2 = 6 > 4
Move left to 1, remove 8 from deques.
Max Length = 1
Index	Value	Increase Deque	Decrease Deque	Left	Right	Max Length
1	2	[2]	[2]	1	1	1
Iteration 3: Right = 2
Add 4 to increase and decrease.
Deques after adding: increase = [2, 4], decrease = [4, 2]
Difference: 4 - 2 = 2 ≤ 4
Max Length = 2
Index	Value	Increase Deque	Decrease Deque	Left	Right	Max Length
2	4	[2, 4]	[4, 2]	1	2	2
Iteration 4: Right = 3
Add 7 to increase and decrease.
Deques after adding: increase = [2, 4, 7], decrease = [7, 4, 2]
Difference: 7 - 2 = 5 > 4
Move left to 2, remove 2 from deques.
Difference: 7 - 4 = 3 ≤ 4
Max Length = 2
Index	Value	Increase Deque	Decrease Deque	Left	Right	Max Length
3	7	[4, 7]	[7, 4]	2	3	2
Final Result
The size of the longest subarray with the absolute difference ≤ limit is 2.
