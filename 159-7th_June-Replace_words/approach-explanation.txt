Intuition
The goal is to replace words in the sentence with their shortest root from the dictionary.
We use a set for fast lookups to determine if a prefix is a root.
For each word in the sentence, we check its prefixes and replace it with the shortest matching root.
Approach
Create Set of Roots:
Convert the dictionary into a set for quick lookups.
Process Each Word:
Split the sentence into words.
For each word, iterate over its prefixes to find the shortest root in the set.
Construct Result Sentence:
Build the result sentence by appending each found prefix or the word itself if no prefix is found.
Complexity
Time complexity:O(n+m+kâ‹…l^2)
Space complexity:O(n+m)
