Intuition
Simply generate all the substrings using recursion and check if they are palindrome or not.If not Backtrack form there.Recursively traverse over the string like in dfs.

Approach
The idea is to keep track of the last partition index and to iterate from that index to the end of the array to check whether we can form a palindrome substring or not. If we are able to find such a substring we use recursion to continue exploring . If we reach the end whole string it means we were able to partition the string into x number of palindromes. Save the result and backtrack to continue exploring.

Complexity
Time complexity:(O(nâˆ—2n)
Space complexity:O(n)
