Frequency Counting:

Two vectors (freq1 and freq2) are used to count the frequency of each letter in word1 and word2.
freq1[i] stores the count of the i-th letter in the English alphabet in word1, and similarly for freq2.
Checking Presence of Characters:

Iterate over each character in the alphabet.
If a character is present in one word and not in the other (or vice versa), return false.
This ensures that both words contain the same set of characters.
Sorting Frequencies:

Sort the frequency vectors (freq1 and freq2).
This step is necessary because the order of frequencies doesn't matter, only their values.
Comparing Sorted Frequencies:

Iterate through the sorted frequency vectors and compare corresponding elements.
If any corresponding elements are not equal, return false.
Final Result:

If all the checks pass, return true, indicating that the two words are "close" as per the problem definition.
