We know that :
ASCII value of uppercase alphabets – 65 to 90.
ASCII value of lowercase alphabets – 97 to 122.

so there are certain steps we have to take to grab the essence of it

step 1: first we have to initialize a pointer flag which will cutoff the loop when there no lower,upper pair found

step 2: we have to iterate throughout the loop and check whether there is any lower upper pair available,if yes delete it and continue the process.

step 3:define a func which will check accordingly if a pair exists or not: thus we will have our output string .

Ex.leEeetcode
first iter: leEeetcode ->first pair found delete it
second iter: leetcode -> no pair found hence return it as flag==1.

Time complexity = O(N)
space complexity = O(1)
