Intuition
The goal is to find the maximum difference between the values of any ancestor and descendant nodes in a binary tree. To achieve this, we need to track the minimum and maximum values encountered during the traversal.

Approach
Initialize the minimum and maximum values to the root node's value.
Traverse the tree using a recursive approach.
Update the minimum and maximum values encountered during the traversal.
At each node, calculate the difference between the current node's value and the updated minimum and maximum values.
Update the global maximum difference if a larger difference is found.
Recursively explore the left and right subtrees.
Return the maximum difference after the traversal.
Complexity
Time complexity: The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.
Space complexity: The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the recursion stack could go as deep as the height of the tree.
