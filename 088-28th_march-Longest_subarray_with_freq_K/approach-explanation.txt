Intuition
My first thought when approaching this problem is to use a sliding window technique because we are dealing with finding the longest subarray with a given condition. Since we are required to find the longest subarray with each element's frequency less than or equal to k, we can use a sliding window to efficiently keep track of the frequency of elements within a subarray.

Approach
Initialize two pointers, l and r, to mark the left and right boundaries of the current subarray.
Initialize an unordered_map to store the frequency of elements within the current subarray.
Iterate through the array from left to right using the right pointer r.
Increment the frequency of nums[r] in the map.
If the frequency of nums[r] exceeds k, we need to shrink the window from the left until the frequency new inserted element decrease by one.
Update the maximum length of the good subarray if necessary.
Return the maximum length found.
