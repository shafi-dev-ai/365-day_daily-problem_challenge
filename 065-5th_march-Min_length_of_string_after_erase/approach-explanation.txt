Approach
Initialize two pointers, l and r, pointing to the start and end of the string respectively.
While l is less than r and the characters at l and r are equal, do the following:
a. Save the character at l (or r, since they are equal).
b. Move l to the right until either it reaches r or the character at l changes.
c. Move r to the left until either it reaches l or the character at r changes.
Return the minimum length of the remaining string after removing the common prefixes and suffixes.
Here's the step-by-step explanation of the code:

It starts by initializing two pointers l and r at the start and end of the string respectively.
Then it enters a while loop which continues as long as l is less than r and the characters at l and r are the same.
Inside the loop, it saves the character at l (or r since they are equal).
Then it moves l to the right until either it reaches r or the character at l changes. This ensures it traverses the prefix.
Similarly, it moves r to the left until either it reaches l or the character at r changes. This ensures it traverses the suffix.
Finally, it returns the minimum length of the remaining string after removing the common prefixes and suffixes.
