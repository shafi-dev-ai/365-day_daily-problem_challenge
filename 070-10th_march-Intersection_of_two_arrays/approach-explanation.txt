Intuition
Don't want to use set or unorderd_set, just lookat the constraints 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000, container bitset<1001> is very suitable

Approach
Find A,BA, BA,B which are implemented by bitset or boolean arrays
Push back the elements in the intersection A∩BA\cap BA∩B to ans.
Return ans.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(∣nums1∣+∣nums2∣)

Space complexity:
O(1)
