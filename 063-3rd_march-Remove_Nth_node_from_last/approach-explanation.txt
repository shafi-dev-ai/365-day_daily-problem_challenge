Intuition
The removeNthFromEnd function appears to remove the n-th node from the end of a singly-linked list.

Approach
Define a helper function length_ll to calculate the length of the linked list.
Calculate the length of the linked list using the helper function.
If the length is 1, return NULL since there is only one node, and removing it would make the list empty.
If the length is equal to n, return head->next to remove the first node.
Iterate through the list to reach the node before the one to be removed. Update the next pointer of this node to skip the n-th node.
Return the modified head of the list.
Complexity
Time complexity:
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the linked list. The function iterates through the list once to calculate its length and then once more to remove the n-th node from the end.
Space complexity:
Space complexity: O(1), The function uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input linked list.
