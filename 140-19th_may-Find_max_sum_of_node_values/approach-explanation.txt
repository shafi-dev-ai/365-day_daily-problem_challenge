Intuition
Question is hard. Use DP to solve. edges is ignored!
DP recurion+memo->tabular->optimized space

Approach
Let 0 be the root.
Let f(i, c)=dp[i][c] denote the max sum from the root to i where c is the number (modulo 2) of XORing operations applied.

The hardest part is to find the recursive relation between vertices i & i+1. Since LC says that this undirected graph is a tree, there exists always an path between i & i+1. An operation is applied, then 2 operations for XORing with k are done.

# Let x=nums[i], consider not taking x^k , taking x^k
f(i, c)= max(x+f(i+1, c),(x^k)+f(i+1,1-c)) 
Xoring is performing in pair, for base case, let n=len(nums),

if i==n:
# invalid path, any negative integer with large enough absolute value
    if c==1: return -(1<<31) 
return 0 # base case
