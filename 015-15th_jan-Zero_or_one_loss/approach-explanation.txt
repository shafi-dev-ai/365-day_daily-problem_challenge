Approach:-

Data Structures:

Maintain three sets: zeroLoss, oneLoss, and moreLoss to keep track of the winners in different categories based on their losses.
Processing Matches:

Iterate through each match in the input vector matches.
For each match, identify the winner and loser.
Handling Winners:

Check if the winner has zero losses (zeroLoss) and hasn't moved to oneLoss or moreLoss.
If so, insert the winner into zeroLoss.
Handling Losers:

Determine the category of the loser based on their current status in sets.
Move the loser from zeroLoss to oneLoss if they were in zeroLoss.
Move the loser from oneLoss to moreLoss if they were in oneLoss.
If the loser is already in moreLoss, skip.
Building the Answer:

Create a 2D vector answer with two rows: one for winners with zero losses and the other for winners with one loss.
Populate the rows of answer with the winners from corresponding sets, sorted in ascending order.
Return Result:

Return the answer vector containing the winners in different categories.
