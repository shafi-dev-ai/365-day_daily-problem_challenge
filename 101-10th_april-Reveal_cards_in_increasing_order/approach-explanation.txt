Problem Explaination:
We have an array deck representing a deck of cards.
We need to simulate the process of revealing cards in increasing order after a certain shuffling of the deck.
üß†Thinking Behind the Solution:
Sorting the deck first helps us start with the smallest card.
Using a deque helps in maintaining the positions (indices) in the result array, ensuring that we place the cards in the correct order for revealing.
The simulation process mimics the process of revealing the cards from the shuffled deck in the desired order.
‚úÖApproach:
Sort the Deck:

Begin by sorting the deck in ascending order. This will help us to start with the smallest card.
Simulate the Reveal Process:

Create a result array of the same size as deck to store the revealed cards in the desired order.
Use a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the indices of the result array. This deque will help in maintaining the order of the cards during the simulation.
Simulation Process:

Start by placing the smallest card (after sorting) at the beginning of the result array (index 0).
For each card in the sorted deck:
Remove the first index from the deque and assign the current card to this index in the result array.
Check if there deque is empty, if not:
Move the index to the end of the deque.
Final Result:

After processing all cards, the result array will contain the deck in the required order for revealing the cards in increasing order.
Let's walkthroughüö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the implementation process with an example for better understandingüéØ:
Let's use the input [17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7] and go through each step of the simulation to reveal the cards in increasing order.

Input:
Deck: [17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7]

Step-by-Step Simulation:
Sort the Deck:

Sorted Deck: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
Initialize Variables:

deck: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
n (size of deck): 7
result: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (initialized with zeros)
indices: deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
Simulation Process:
1st Card (2):
card: 2
idx (popped from indices): 0
result after assigning 2 at idx: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
indices after moving next index: 1 to the end: deque([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1])
2nd Card (3):
card: 3
idx (popped from indices): 2
result after assigning 3 at idx: [2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
indices after moving next index: 3 to the end: deque([4, 5, 6, 1, 3])
3rd Card (5):
card: 5
idx (popped from indices): 4
result after assigning 5 at idx: [2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0]
indices after moving next index: 5 to the end: deque([6, 1, 3, 5])
4th Card (7):
card: 7
idx (popped from indices): 6
result after assigning 7 at idx: [2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7]
indices after moving 3 to the end: deque([3, 5, 1])
5th Card (11):
card: 11
idx (popped from indices): 3
result after assigning 11 at idx: [2, 0, 3, 11, 5, 0, 7]
indices after moving 4 to the end: deque([1, 5])
6th Card (13):
card: 13
idx (popped from indices): 1
result after assigning 13 at idx: [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 0, 7]
indices after moving 5 to the end: deque([5])
7th Card (17):
card: 17
idx (popped from indices): 6
result after assigning 17 at idx: [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7]
indices after moving 6 to the end: deque([])
Final Result:
The result array after simulating the process will be [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7], which represents the deck of cards revealed in increasing order.
