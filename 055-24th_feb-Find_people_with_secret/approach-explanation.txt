The problem appears to involve finding all people who know a secret within a network of meetings. It seems that the solution involves traversing the meetings and maintaining a set of people who know the secret.

Approach
Sort the meetings based on their time.
Iterate through the sorted meetings.
For each meeting group at a specific time, construct a graph where nodes represent people and edges represent connections between people who attended the same meeting.
Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the people who already know the secret within that meeting group.
Add all encountered people during the BFS traversal to the set of people who know the secret.
Repeat the process for each meeting group.
Return the final set of people who know the secret.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(nlogn+m) where n is the number of meetings and m is the total number of attendees in all meetings.
Space complexity:
O(m), where m is the total number of attendees in all meetings.
The space complexity arises from maintaining sets, graphs, and queues to store the information about attendees and their relationships.

The time complexity is dominated by the sorting of meetings O(nlogn) and the BFS traversal O(m), where m is the total number of attendees in all meetings.
