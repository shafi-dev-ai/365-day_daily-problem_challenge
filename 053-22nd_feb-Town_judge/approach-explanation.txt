Approach:

Initialization: Initialize two vectors, in and out, to store the in-degree and out-degree of each person.

Counting Trust Relationships: Iterate through each trust relationship, incrementing the out count for the truster and the in count for the trustee.

Finding the Judge: Iterate through each person, checking if they have an in-degree of N - 1 and an out-degree of 0, indicating they are trusted by everyone and trust no one.

Return Value: Return the index of the judge if found, otherwise return -1.

Overall Functionality: The function identifies the judge within a community based on trust relationships, leveraging counts of in-degree and out-degree.
