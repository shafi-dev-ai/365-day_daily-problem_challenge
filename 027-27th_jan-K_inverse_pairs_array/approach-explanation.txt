Approach:-
Dynamic Programming:

Use a 2D array dp to store the number of arrays with at most k inverse pairs for each size i and number of inverse pairs j.
Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 as a base case.
Recurrence Relation:

For each i and j, iterate over x to compute the number of arrays with at most k inverse pairs.
Update dp[i][j] based on the recurrence relation: dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - x]) % 1000000007.
Result:

The final result is stored in dp[n][k], representing the number of arrays with at most k inverse pairs for an array of size n.
