Breadth-First Search (BFS):
ApproachðŸ˜Ž:
Initialize: Traverse through each cell of the grid.
BFS Traversal: When encountering a cell with the value 1 (indicating farmland) and not visited:
Use BFS to explore the entire connected region of farmland starting from this cell.
During BFS traversal, use a queue to process cells level by level.
Keep track of the boundaries (min/max row and column) of the current region.
Marking Farmland: Mark visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
Recording Rectangles: Record the boundaries of each identified rectangle.
Output: Once all regions are explored, return the list of identified rectangles.
AlgorithmðŸ˜Ž:
Initialize a queue (queue) to perform BFS and a set (visited) to keep track of visited cells.
Iterate through each cell (i, j) in the grid:
If land[i][j] is 1 and (i, j) is not visited:
Initialize min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col to the current cell (i, j).
Enqueue (i, j) into the queue and mark it as visited.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a cell (cur_i, cur_j) from the queue.
Explore its four neighboring cells (nx, ny) (up, down, left, right).
If (nx, ny) is within the grid bounds and land[nx][ny] is 1 and not visited:
Enqueue (nx, ny).
Mark (nx, ny) as visited.
Update min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col based on (nx, ny).
After BFS completes for the current region, record the rectangle [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col].
Return the list of identified rectangles.
