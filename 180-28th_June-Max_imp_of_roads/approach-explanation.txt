Intuition
sort vector<pair<size of hashtable of node, node>> and assign values

Approach
Create graph i.e. vector<unordered_set> which has an hash table for each node to keep its children
make a vector<pair<size of hashtable of node, node>>
fill up and sort this vector
Now value of each node is = i+1 of its position in this sorted vector
Create a Hashmap for quick value finding of each node
Traverse given roads vector and add up values of each road given
Complexity
Time complexity:
let road.size()=m
TC : O(2m+2n+nlogn)
Space complexity: O(n^2+n+n)
