Intuition
Count Frequency in All Words:
For each character, count how many times it appears in each word.
Minimum Frequency Across Words:
For each character that appears in all words, take the minimum count across all words. This will ensure that only the common occurrences are considered.
Result Construction:
Use the minimum counts to construct the list of common characters, including duplicates.

Approach
Initialize Frequency Array:
Create a frequency array min_freq to store the minimum frequency of each character across all words. Initialize it to a large number (since we will be looking for the minimum).
Update Frequencies:
For each word, count the frequency of each character and update the min_freq array accordingly.
Build Result:
Traverse the min_freq array and construct the result based on the minimum frequency values.
