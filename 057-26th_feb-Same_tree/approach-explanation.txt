Approach:
Base Case Handling: Checks if both trees are empty. If so, returns true.
Null Check: If one tree is empty while the other is not, returns false.
Value Comparison: Compares the values of the current nodes in both trees.
Recursive Calls: Recursively calls the function for left subtrees and right subtrees.
Return: Returns true if all conditions hold true, indicating identical trees; otherwise, returns false.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)
(n is the number of nodes in the tree)

Space complexity:
O(h)
(h is the height of the tree)
