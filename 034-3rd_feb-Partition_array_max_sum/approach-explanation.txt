Approach:

Uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum after partitioning an array.

Initializing an array dp to store the maximum sum at each position.

Iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. For each position, considering all possible partitions of the array.

Within each partition, we calculates the maximum value and updates the dynamic programming array dp to store the maximum sum.

The final result is stored in dp[0], representing the maximum sum after partitioning the entire array.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(nâˆ—k)
(where N is the size of the input array and K is the given parameter)

Space complexity:
O(k)
