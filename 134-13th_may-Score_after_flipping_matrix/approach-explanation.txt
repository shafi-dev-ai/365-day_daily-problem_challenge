Intuition
By maximizing the number of set bits in the most significant bit positions, we can achieve maxximum possoble score.

Approach: Greedy + Toggling
Here's how the approach works:

Initial Score Initialization: We initially assume that all the bits in the most significant position are set bits, which can be done by multiplying the number of rowws n with the value represented by the most significant bit (1 << (m - 1)).

Column Toggling: We then iterate over the remaining columns (from the second column to the last column) to determine whether toggling (flipping) the entire column would increase the score or not.

Value of the Current Column: We then calculate a value val for each column j represented by that column's bit position (1 << (m - 1 - j)).

Counting Matching Rows: We then count the number of rows represented by set , where the value in the current column j matches the value in the first column (0 or 1) by iterating over all rows and comparing grid[i][j] with grid[i][0].

To Toggle or Not: If the number of rows set is greater than or equal to n/2 (half the number of rows), its beneficial for us to not toggle (flip) the column. Otherwise, its better to toggle (flip) the entire column to increase the score.

Updating the Score: We then update the res score by adding the maximum value between set * val (if the column is kept unchanged) and (n - set) * val (if the column is toggled), ensuring that the score is maximized by either keeping the current column unchanged or toggling it.

Resulting Score: After iterating through all columns, we return the maximum score res.

This approach works because toggling a row or a column affects all the bits in that row or column simultaneously. By ensuring that the most significant bits are set to 1 in as many rows as possible, and then adjusting the remaining columns based on the majority values, we can maximize the score of the matrix.
