Intuition
Use 2 pointers slow & fast to detect the cycle. Floyd's Algorithm
(Tortoise and Hare Algorithm)

Approach
If once fast==slow then there is a cycle, otherwise til null.
In usual, the stride for slow is taken 1, and the stride for fast is taken 2.
In 2nd approach, the stride for slow is taken 2, and the stride for fast is taken 3. since 2, 3 are coprime, if there is a cycle, fast & slow will meet.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)
