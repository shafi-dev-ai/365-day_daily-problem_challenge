Problem ExplainationüéØ:
The Number of Islands problem involves finding and counting distinct clusters of connected '1's (representing land) in a 2D grid, where each '1' represents a piece of land and each '0' represents water.

üîç Methods To Solve This Problem:
I'll be covering two different methods to solve this problem:

Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Depth-First Search (DFS):
The DFS approach involves exploring each cell in the grid. When encountering a '1' (representing land), it signifies the start of a new island. The goal is to explore and mark all connected land cells (forming an island) using recursive DFS.

DFS Function: Define a recursive DFS function that takes the grid and the current cell coordinates (i, j) as parameters.

If the cell is out of the grid boundaries or not land ('1'), return.
Mark the current cell as visited by changing it from '1' to '0'.
Recursively call DFS for the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) to explore and mark all connected land cells.
Main Function:

Iterate through each cell in the grid.
When encountering an unvisited '1', increment the island count and trigger DFS to explore and mark all connected land cells belonging to this island.
