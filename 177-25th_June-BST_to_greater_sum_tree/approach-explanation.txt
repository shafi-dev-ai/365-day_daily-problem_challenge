Intuition
To convert a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a Greater Tree, we need to ensure that every node's value is updated to the sum of all values greater than or equal to the node's value. In a BST, an in-order traversal gives us the nodes in increasing order. To achieve the desired transformation, we need to traverse the tree in reverse in-order (right-root-left), accumulating the sum of the node values as we go.

Approach
Reverse In-Order Traversal:

We traverse the BST starting from the rightmost node (which has the largest value) to the leftmost node (which has the smallest value).
While traversing, we keep a running total (sum) of all the node values we have seen so far.
As we visit each node, we update its value by adding the current sum to the node's value and then update sum to this new value.
Recursive Function:

We use a helper function to perform the reverse in-order traversal.
This function will be called recursively first on the right subtree, then the current node, and finally on the left subtree.
Step by Step Explanation
Example:

Input BST:

        4
       / \
      1   6
     / \ / \
    0  2 5  7
         \   \
          3   8
Steps:

Traverse to the rightmost node:
Current Node: 8, Sum: 0, New Node Value: 8, Updated Sum: 8
Move to 7:
Current Node: 7, Sum: 8, New Node Value: 15, Updated Sum: 15
Continue to 6:
Current Node: 6, Sum: 15, New Node Value: 21, Updated Sum: 21
Continue to 5:
Current Node: 5, Sum: 21, New Node Value: 26, Updated Sum: 26
Move to 4:
Current Node: 4, Sum: 26, New Node Value: 30, Updated Sum: 30
Continue to 3:
Current Node: 3, Sum: 30, New Node Value: 33, Updated Sum: 33
Move to 2:
Current Node: 2, Sum: 33, New Node Value: 35, Updated Sum: 35
Continue to 1:
Current Node: 1, Sum: 35, New Node Value: 36, Updated Sum: 36
Finally, move to 0:
Current Node: 0, Sum: 36, New Node Value: 36, Updated Sum: 36
Output BST:

        30
       / \
      36   21
     / \ / \
    36 35 26  15
         \   \
          33  8
Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the traversal.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack. However, this can be reduced to O(h) where h is the height of the tree, if the tree is balanced.
