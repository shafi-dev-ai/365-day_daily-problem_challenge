Use recursive preorder to transverse.
If an extra parameter isLeft=0 is set, the code becomes much simpler. The following is written in Python:

def f(root, isLeft=False):
    if not root: return 0
    if not root.left and not root.right and isLeft: return root.val
    return f(root.left, True)+f(root.right, False)
Iterative DFS C & C++ codes are also provided using an array/vector as a stack; since C++ vector has all members for the stack. C array can implement a stack.
