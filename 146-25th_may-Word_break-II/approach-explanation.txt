Intuition
This problem is similar to rod cutting problem in which we have to make optimal cuts but in this we will be finding all the possible ways of cuts.

Approach
Step 1: Convert the given dictionary list into unordered_map so that we can optimally check whether the word exist in the dictionary or not.

Step 2: Cut words from the given string and check whether it exist in the map or not.
If it exist then call the solve function for remaining string
else continue because if a word does not exist in the
dictionary then its of no use.

Step 3: Keep track of the current sentence by pushing and popping word from it.

Step 4: If we reach at the end of givenString then we got 1 of our possible answers add it to the list of answers.

Step 5: Return the answers.
