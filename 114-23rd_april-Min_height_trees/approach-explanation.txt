Intuition
Kahnâ€™s Algorithm for Topological Sorting is for the directed graph.
But modify it one can also solve the this undirected graph problem.

Approach
Instead of indegree in a directed graph, count the degree for every vertex.

Build the adjacency list adj & compute the deg for each vertex.
Push all vertices with deg=1 to the queue q
Proceed BFS while the q is not empty, removing the edge connecting v, when the adjacent vetex w has deg(w)=1, push it to q. With a care look how many vertices are left. If none, the center are found.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(n)
