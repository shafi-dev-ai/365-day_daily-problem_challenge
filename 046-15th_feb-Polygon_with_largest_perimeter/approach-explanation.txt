Approach-
Sort the array: Start by sorting the array of numbers in ascending order.

Initialize variables: Set up variables to track the running sum (sum) and the largest perimeter found so far (ans).

Iterate through the sorted array: Loop through each number in the sorted array.

Check polygon condition: For each number, check if it's smaller than the sum of all previous numbers encountered.

Update largest perimeter: If the condition is met, update ans with the sum of the current number and the running sum. Finally, return the largest perimeter found (ans).
