Intuition
Convert the chars to int & compare the numbers x1 & x2
Use a nested loop to solve.

Approach
Use a nested loop with condition i<n1 || j<n2
The conversion of chars to int is using
while(i<n1 && v1[i]!='.'){
    x1=10*x1+(v1[i++]-'0');
}
the conversion to x2 is similar.
3. At the end of this iteration in the loop

if (x1<x2) return -1;
else if (x1>x2) return 1;
x1=0;
x2=0;
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n1+n2)

Space complexity:
O(1)
