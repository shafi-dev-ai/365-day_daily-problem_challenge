ü§î Intuition
The problem asks us to find the length of the longest ideal string, where an ideal string satisfies two conditions:

It is a subsequence of the given string 's'.
The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in the string is less than or equal to 'k'.
üõ†Ô∏è Approach
Initialize an array dp of size 27 to store the length of the longest ideal string ending at each character.
Iterate through the string 's' from right to left.
For each character, calculate the index in the array 'dp' based on its ASCII value and subtract 'a' (97) to get the index from 0 to 26.
Determine the range of possible previous characters based on the value of 'k'.
Iterate through this range and find the maximum value of 'dp'.
Update 'dp' at the current character's index with the maximum value found plus 1.
After processing all characters, find the maximum value in the 'dp' array, which represents the length of the longest ideal string.
Return this maximum value as the result.
Complexity üìä
Time complexity:
The loop iterates through the string 's' once, and for each character, it may iterate through a constant range of characters (bounded by 'k'). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Space complexity:
We use an array 'dp' of size 27 to store the lengths of ideal strings, which is constant space. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
